In this repository you will find a good amount of free resources to learn about artificial intelligence, machine learning and other related areas. Some of these resources includes videos and free courses from trusted sources.

Feel free to add any relevant resource.


## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.


### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that, faced with an unfamiliar task, the AI system could find a solution. An AGI system could perform any task that a human is capable of.

## Machine learning
Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. In the recent years Machine Learning has been successful for the increase availability of computational processing power, data and enhancement of advanced algorithms.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.
